* What is the core idea?
The authors of the paper introduce a new architecture, Mask R-CNN, for object instance segmentation.
This new method builds off of Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the exisiting branch for bounding box recognition.
Mask R-CNN is proved to be easy to train and and generalize to other tasks such as estimating human poses.

* How is it realized (technically)?



* How well does the paper perform?


* What interesting variants are explored?

## TL;DR
* Three
* Bullets
* To highlight the core concepts
