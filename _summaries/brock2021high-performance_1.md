# Core Idea
The paper aims to create a class of Normalizer Free ResNets that are competative with the current state of the art.

An adaptive gradient clipping technique introdued can be used without any batch normalization and allows for smaller ResNet variants to be trained faster without a loss of accuracy and is used in their largest model which sets a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy on Imagenet.
