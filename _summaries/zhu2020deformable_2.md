## Core Idea
Extends DETR by focusing the attention modules onto a small set of sampling points allowing for better results in fewer training epochs. 
It also addresses the issues DETR has when attempting to detect small objects. 


## Technical Implementation
Issues with DETR
- Requires significantly more training epochs than other object detectors
- Struggles with small objects

TODO: Summarize the paper:
* What is the core idea?
* How is it realized (technically)?
* How well does the paper perform?
* What interesting variants are explored?

## TL;DR
* Three
* Bullets
* To highlight the core concepts
