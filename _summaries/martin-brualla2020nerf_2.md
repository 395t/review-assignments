## What is the core idea?
* NeRF works well on images of static subjects captured under controlled settings but it fails to model real-world variabilities in uncontrolled images, such as  illumination or transient occluders
* NeRF-W (this paper) extends NeRF to address these issues and is able to render accurate reconstructions from unstructured image collections taken from the internet!

* How is it realized (technically)?
* How well does the paper perform?
* What interesting variants are explored?

## TL;DR
* Three
