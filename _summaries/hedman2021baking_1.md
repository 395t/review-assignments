TODO: Summarize the paper:
## What is the core idea?
NeRF is a good method to recreate 3D scenes from viewpoints unobserved by the system. However, it is computationally intensive and cannot be applied in real-time. The authors proposed a novel approach to train NeRF called Sparse Neural Radiance Grid (SNeRG) and achieved real-time rendering. 

## How is it realized (technically)?

* How well does the paper perform?
* What interesting variants are explored?

## TL;DR
* Three
* Bullets
* To highlight the core concepts
