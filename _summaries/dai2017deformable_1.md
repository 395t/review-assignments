## What is the core idea?
* Standard CNNs use fixed geometric shape: a convolution unit samples the input feature map at fixed locations; a pooling layer reduces the spatial resolution at a
fixed ratio
* This paper proposes Deformable Convolution Networks (`DCN`) which enables convolution/RoI pooling units to **learn to deform the sampling locations**
