# Assignments for paper reviews

1. Write you review.

- Go into `_summaries/` and find your assigned summary in the format of `${paper_tag}_{1/2}.md`.

- Replace `paper` and `author` with your assigned one and your github id.

- Write up the contents.


2. (Optional) Preview your review locally.

- Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

- Run `jekyll build` and `jekyll serve`. You can see how your review (`${paper_tag}_{1/2}.html`) looks like locally.

  Only minimal template is provided in this repo so it'll look a bit different from the class page.

3. Commit your review.

Create your own branch and create a PR to the main branch. Name your branch `paper_tag+your github id`.
