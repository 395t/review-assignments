I"˜<p>TODO: Summarize the paper:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the core idea?</li>
  <li>How is it realized (technically)?</li>
  <li>How well does the paper perform?</li>
  <li>What interesting variants are explored?</li>
</ul>

<p>The vanishing gradient problem as been a problem of training Deep Neural Nets.The core idea of the Exponetial Linear Units centers around shifting the mean and the activation function to zero whereby increasing the learning rate as well a performance.</p>

<p>A function \(f_1(x)\) would now become \(f_2(x) = x + g(x)\).</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
