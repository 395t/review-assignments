I"ƒ<p>This is one of those papers thatâ€™s well ahead of its time.
The paper explores the use ConvNets for optical character recognition, and graph neural networks (called graph transformer, not to be confused with the new fancy transformers) for text recognition.
At 40+ pages itâ€™s a true beast of a paper, but most of the space is devoted to a gentle introduction to deep learning.</p>
