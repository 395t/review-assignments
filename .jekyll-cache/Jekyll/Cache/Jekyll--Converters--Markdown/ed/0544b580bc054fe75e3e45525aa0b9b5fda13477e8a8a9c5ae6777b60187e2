<h3 id="main-contributions">Main Contributions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This paper demonstrates that deep neural network (DNN) models for speech recognition perform better when they use rectifier activation functions instead of sigmoidal ones.</li>
  <li>Previous work compares the two, but without isolating all other variables. This paper isolates the effect of the activation function in DNN-based speech recognition.</li>
  <li>The authors theorize that the performance benefit is attributable to ‚Äúsparse-disperse‚Äù coding properties of Rectifier functions and provide evidence in support of this theory.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="motivation-for-rectifier-functions">Motivation for Rectifier Functions</h3>
<p>Drawbacks of sigmoidal activation functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sigmoidal activation functions suffer from ‚Äúvanishing gradients‚Äù which can slow training and/or cause the network to converge to poor local minima.</li>
  <li>They do not induce hard-sparsity (values of 0) in activations, which can be a drawback if you want to use activations as feature representations for some downstream task.
Both of these issues can, in principle, be solved with rectifier activation functions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="experiment-setup">Experiment setup</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Task: Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR)</li>
  <li>Data: 300-hour Switchboard conversational corpus</li>
  <li>Model: DNN with ReLU, Leaky-ReLU, and tanh activation function</li>
  <li>Evaluation metric: word-error rate (WER)</li>
  <li>Side note: the authors validate that their baseline implementations are comparable to existing ones.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Rectifier DNNs produce WER reductions of up to 2% as compared with sigmoidal DNNs, which is a substantial improvement for this task.</li>
  <li>Rectifier DNNs benefit more from depth as compared with sigmoidal DNNs. Each time a hidden layer was added, rectifier DNNs show a greater absolute reduction in WER than sigmoidal DNNs.</li>
  <li>Choice of Rectifier function (leaky vs. non-leaky) does not impact performance. Leaky converges slightly faster.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="analyzing-coding-properties">Analyzing coding properties</h3>
<ul>
  <li>ReLU DNNs contain substantially more sparse representations than sigmoidal DNNs.</li>
  <li>ReLU networks, as compared with tanh networks, produce sparse codes where information is distributed more uniformly across hidden units.</li>
  <li>Information/coding theory suggests that sparsity and dispersion (even distribution of information) are important for invariance to inputs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Rectifier activation functions improve neural-net based speech recognition over sigmoidal functions (tanh).</li>
  <li>Choice of rectifier function (leaky vs. non-leaky) did not matter for this task.</li>
  <li>Rectifier functions produce sparse and evenly distributed representations, which may contribute to the performance increase.</li>
</ul>
