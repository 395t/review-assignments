I"y<p>The core idea of this paper is to challenge the effectiveness of asymmetric activation functions, such as sigmoid, with the traditional, random initialization for deep architecture.
The paper accomplishes this by providing improved results from their normalized initialization process and by using symmetric activation functions such as hyperbolic tangent and softsign.</p>
